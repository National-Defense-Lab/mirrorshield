#### MirrorSheild Experiment by National Defense Lab (www.nationaldefenselab.com)

This repository contains the demonstration code for the MirrorShield project, developed by the National Defense Lab. MirrorShield is an advanced conceptual framework designed to illustrate the use of machine learning and data analysis in the detection and mitigation of disinformation campaigns.

## Project Overview

MirrorShield aims to demonstrate the potential of real-time data processing, machine learning analysis, and automated alerting/reporting to identify and counter disinformation. This script is a prototype that showcases a simplified workflow of how such a system might operate.

Project MirrorShield Details - (https://nationaldefenselab.com/projects/details/project-mirror-shield-advanced-disinformation-countermeasures)

## Dependencies

The script requires the following Python libraries:

- requests
- scikit-learn
- APScheduler
- matplotlib

These dependencies can be installed using the command:

- pip install requests scikit-learn apscheduler matplotlib

  
## Installation

To run this script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Install the required dependencies with the command provided above.
4. Execute the script using the command: `python mirrorshield_demo.py`.

## Components

The script is divided into several modules:

- `Data Ingestion Module`: Handles fetching and normalization of data from various sources.
- `Disinformation Detection Module`: Uses machine learning to analyze text and predict the likelihood of disinformation.
- `Alerting Module`: Sends alerts based on the severity and content of detected disinformation.
- `Reporting Module`: Generates reports including findings and potential impacts of detected disinformation.
- `Main Application Loop`: Orchestrates the execution and scheduling of tasks.

## Usage

The script is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate a potential approach to disinformation detection. It is not designed for production use.

## File Structure

- `mirrorshield_demo.py`: Main Python script for the MirrorShield demonstration.
